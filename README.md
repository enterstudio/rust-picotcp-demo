rust-picotcp-demo
=================

An application in Rust using the PicoTCP library

You will need a libpicotcp.a file in the same directory as this repo. (TODO: add call to Makefile, building this for you)
Then, running 'cargo build' should pull the 'rust-picotcp' dependency, and build it for you, then build de demo app, and link it all together!

Note that this is still very much work-in-progress.

Have fun!
